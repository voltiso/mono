# `@voltiso/config.eslint`

Heavy and strict eslint config.

Use with `pnpm`.

> ⚠️ Peer deps listed as deps!
>
> - Deps that should be peer have `*` version
> 	- Deps with normal semver are regular deps
> - Hopefully we won't duplicate deps but share the ones up in the dep tree
> - Not perfect, versioning was nice, but good for now
> - pnpm's `auto-install-peers` is problematic - maybe will be improved in the future
